An old project I made in highschool inspired by ideas from an internship I had at Koding.com (now non-existent)

The manager suggested that they were having issues with designing an onboarding system (bubbles that say "click here to x", a small help menu on the bottom, etc) and that the only availible options were too expensive and ineffective. Jumped into this project hoping to solve that problem.

I've designed the basic backend infrastructure and began working on an editor to actually place the bubbles where they need to be, make them appear and disappear at appropriate times, etc. 

Project was left unfinished because I was a suggestible highschooler who switch schools to a place that didn't have a programming department and took a bigger interest towards theoretical mathematics.

The project is designed with Nodejs.
